            <h1>UI/UX <span>Design</span></h1>
            <p>I specialize in crafting clean, user-friendly, and intuitive interface designs using Figma. 
                From wireframes to interactive prototypes, I design digital products that focus on usability, 
                accessibility, and aesthetic appeal. My process includes understanding user needs, structuring 
                smooth navigation flows, and applying modern design trends to ensure an engaging user experience.<br>
                Whether it’s a website, mobile app, or a dashboard interface, I pay close attention to spacing, 
                color balance, typography, and responsiveness. Every design is tested for usability and tailored to 
                the target audience, ensuring not just good looks — but also clarity and functionality.</p>

            <h1>APP <span>Development</span></h1>
            <p>As an app developer, I focus on building functional, user-friendly, and visually engaging web and 
                mobile applications. I use technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks to 
                turn creative ideas and UI designs into real, working apps that perform smoothly across different devices.<br>
                I’ve worked on practical projects like Weathersense, a weather app with live data integration, responsive 
                design, and a clean interface. These experiences have helped me develop strong skills in interface 
                design, performance optimization, and ensuring a great user experience.<br>
                From simple tools to full-scale applications, I enjoy bringing concepts to life through code. 
                I also collaborate with designers using tools like Figma, converting visual designs into fully 
                functional applications that meet real-world needs.</p>

            <p>I offer complete web development services, combining custom coding and popular website builders to 
                create fast, responsive, and professional websites. I use technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                and also work with CMS platforms such as WordPress and Wix.com to deliver modern web solutions 
                tailored to each client’s needs.<br>
                Whether you're looking for a fully custom-coded website or a flexible platform that’s easy to manage, 
                I can help bring your vision to life. From design and layout to functionality and deployment, I focus on 
                delivering user-friendly, mobile-optimized, and visually appealing websites.<br>
                I have experience building everything from portfolios and business websites to landing pages, using both code-based tools
                and drag-and-drop website builders, based on what best suits the project.

            <h1>Graphic <span>Design</span></h1>
            <p>As the founder of <b>Pixelwave Graphic Design,</b> I create visually compelling designs that help 
                brands stand out. My work includes logo design, posters, flyers, social media posts, business 
                cards, and more — all crafted to match the tone and personality of each client or project.<br>
                I focus on combining creativity with clarity, making sure every design delivers the right message 
                to the right audience. Whether it's a personal brand, startup, or social media campaign, I work 
                closely with client needs to produce professional, high-quality visual content.<br>
                My design process involves exploring ideas, building strong visual structure, and refining 
                each element to ensure balance, color harmony, and impact. I always aim for clean, modern, 
                and eye-catching visuals that leave a lasting impression.</p>

            <p>I create engaging and creative video content for platforms like Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and for 
                client-based projects. My editing style focuses on storytelling, rhythm, and visual impact — 
                combining transitions, audio syncing, motion effects, and color grading to produce eye-catching 
                results.<br>
                I make funny videos for social media pages, music videos for platforms like TikTok, and do paid 
                edits for Sinhala songs, where I design visuals that match the tone and feel of each track. I also 
                work with text animations, lyrics syncing, and effects to enhance viewer engagement.<br>
                Recently, I’ve been exploring AI-powered tools like Veo AI, which help elevate video production 
                quality with automated motion analysis, cinematic composition, and creative enhancement.

            <h1>ML/DL <span>Projects</span></h1>
            <p>While I’m still growing my skills in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I have hands-on 
                experience building small but practical projects that solve real-world problems. I enjoy exploring 
                how intelligent systems can be built using data, models, and prediction techniques.<br>
                Some of my recent projects include a Diabetes Prediction Model, where I trained a supervised 
                learning algorithm to predict diabetic conditions based on medical inputs. I also developed a 
                Market Prediction Web App, which uses a basic deep learning model to forecast trends from user-provided data.<br>
                These projects helped me understand concepts like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and 
                neural network basics, and how to integrate ML models into web apps.</p>
