            <h2><span>Description: </span> </h2>
            <h3>Using Veo AI, I created a cinematic-style video inspired by the Assassin‚Äôs Creed universe. 
                This project was an experimental blend of AI video generation and manual editing, focused on 
                crafting immersive visuals that reflect the iconic stealth, action, and atmosphere of the 
                franchise.<br><br>
                ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Process:<br>
                Veo AI for generating realistic scenes and motion<br>
                CapCut for trimming, layering, and syncing effects<br>
                Sound design and music added to match the mood and pacing<br><br>

                This video highlights my creative storytelling abilities combined with modern AI tools, pushing
                 the boundaries of traditional editing. It was designed primarily for Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, 
                 optimized for short-form cinematic engagement.</h3>

                Edited using CapCut with careful attention to storytelling, smooth transitions, and emotional pacing<br>
                Included real footage of student activities, library construction, and team collaboration<br>
                Background music and captions were added to enhance the message and make it accessible for a wide audience<br>
                Used for presentation, social media sharing, and project documentation<br><br>

                üß¨This web app can: <br>
                Predict the price movement (up/down) <br>
                Predict the next-day closing price <br>
                Use real-time data from Yahoo Finance <br>
                Display results with interactive visualizations <br><br>
                Technologies Used: <br>

            <h3>I completed an assignment for the Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics subject, where I built 
                a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. The model 
                uses key health indicators such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure to classify 
                individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. The project helped me explore the practical applications 
                of machine learning algorithms and improve my skills in data analysis and model evaluation.
